# SPACING OUT

This is my (WIP) take on Escape Veocity, a game I loved when I was a kid. This was started as a class project for Video Game Development at Missouri State University, and I plan to continue messing with it as time allows.

## Overview
---
Spacing Out will eventually be a top-down space trucking and combat game with a variety of ships, cargo, and NPCs to interact with. You'll be able to choose from a variety of gameplay options, including (but hopefully not limited to) combat, trade, rescue, and piracy. The end goal will be to make as much money as you can, with it getting progressively harder to do so the longer you play.

You can find this and any other games I make [here at Itch.io.](https://zetapirate.itch.io/ "My Itch.io profile")

Or you can play it [here on github.](https://rpeterson0487.github.io/spacing-out/ "Github pages page")

## Controls:
---
Right now, there isn't much to the game. As it is developed, more controls will be added.
### SPACE (pun intended):
IMMA FIRIN MAH' LAZER. While there isn't currently anything to shoot at, pressing space will shoot, anyway. Have fun.
### UP or W:
Forward thrust. You're in space, so the ship will continue to move until you change direction. Boy, Newton was a pain...
### LEFT or A, and RIGHT or D:
Rotate left or right.
### DOWN or S:
Rotate opposite direction of travel. This will automatically rotate your ship to face opposite of the direction the ship is moving so that you can slow down.
### X:
Full stop: If you are moving slow enough, pressing this key will bring the ship to a full stop, regardless of the direction you are facing. Take that, Newton!
### L:
Land: When you are over a planet (and eventually, a station), press L to open up the planet's (or station's!) menu. This will eventually give you a list of actions you can take while there, including trading commodities, switching ships, staying at a hotel, etc.
### Escape:
Cancel. Right now, this just closes the landing menu. Eventually, it will also pause the game.

## The future
- I would like to add my own artwork (or even artwork I didn't steal from my classmates, and professor, and google images, and...). The current images used are placeholders until I have more time.  Sorry classmates, professor, and Star Trek!

- NPCs! They are all sleeping right now, come back later to get shot at!

- How about an actual game! Coming to a computer near you!<br>
